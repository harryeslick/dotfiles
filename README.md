I suggest you create a fork of this, so you can modify it.

The approach used here is from https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/

To set this up on your machine, use this script `setup_dotfiles.sh`

In that script, change `https://github.com/harryeslick/dotfiles-ai.git` to your fork, before you run it.
